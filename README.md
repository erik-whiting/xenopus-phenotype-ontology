# Xenopus Phenotype Ontology

The Xenopus Phenotype Ontology (XPO) represents phenotypes occurring throughout the development of the African frogs *Xenopus laevis* and *tropicalis*. It is being designed to support curation of phenotype data in [Xenbase](http://www.xenbase.org/) and integrate *Xenopus* data with information about other model organism phenotypes and human disease.

Please note, currently the XPO is in a draft/beta version and is subject to substantial further revision.
